This Photo WaterMark app is quite easy to use.

To use the application, you have to install the Pillow library version 10.4.0 which is in the requirements.txt file.
Run the code on your IDLE and App window should pop up

The app had just two entry fields and their respective buttons. The first is where you select the image you want to add a watermark to.
The second entry field is where you enter the text you want to applied as the watermark, 
then it the "Apply Watermark" button and the image would be saved automatically to your computer with same name/file_path as the original image.
